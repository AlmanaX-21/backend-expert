# Guides

The guides in this directory each have 2 components.

## Explanation

The "explanatory" component of the guide explains how some system works and what its purpose is. <br />
The explanation should be understandable to people with limited technical knowledge.

## Integration

The "integration" component will lay out how to integrate the defined system. <br />
This is a slightly more technical angle to the system so it allows for more complex terminology. This can require some level of technological sophistication but should generally be written in the simplest of ways.
